## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## 3.6. The Reporting Page

Navigate to the Reports page and choose from the following options presented in the Report list box.

*   Deliveries

*   Rejections (As of version 3.0.23.)

*   Bounces

*   Transient Failures

*   Delivery Times

*   Long & Short Codes (Mobile Momentum only)

*   Mobile Latency (Mobile Momentum only)

*   Domain

*   Adaptive Delivery (Available only when the adaptive module is loaded)

### Note

The various reports displayed under this menu are based on the watchlist rather than all traffic. The watchlist is a schema that is created automatically in the ecelerity PostgreSQL database. If you wish to see stats for all domains you need to change the value of the `rt_stats_watchlist_only` option in the ec_rotate.conf file.

As of Momentum version 3.3, a reporting role has been added. For more information see [Section 3.9.1, “Adding the Reporting Role to a User”](web3.users.php#web3.reporting.role.creating "3.9.1. Adding the Reporting Role to a User").

### 3.6.1. Deliveries

When you first navigate to the Reporting page, delivery statistics are displayed. You should see a report such as the following:

<a name="figure_delivery_reports"></a>

**Figure 3.10. Delivery reports**

You must supply a value for each parameter.

Once you have specified criteria, use the RUN REPORT button to display the data. You should see something like the following:

<a name="figure_run_report"></a>

**Figure 3.21. Report data**
