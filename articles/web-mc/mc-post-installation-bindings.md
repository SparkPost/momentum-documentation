## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## 3.4. Creating Bindings

You may wish to associate mailings and campaigns with specific bindings. Any "Permitted Bindings" used by orgs in the web UI (see " [Permitted Bindings](https://support.messagesystems.com/docs/web-mc-user/mc3-administration.php#mc3-administration-orgs-permitted-bindings)") must be set up in Momentum.

### Note

Setting up "Permitted Bindings" through the *Message Central*         web UI does **not** set up the appropriate bindings in the Momentum configuration file. See "[binding](https://support.messagesystems.com/docs/web-ref/conf.ref.binding.php)".

For instructions on creating bindings see ["Bindings"](https://support.messagesystems.com/docs/web-ref/conf.ref.binding.php).
