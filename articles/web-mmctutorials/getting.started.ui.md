## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## Chapter 2. Using the Web-based User Interface

**Introduction**

The User Interface (UI) is a web-based application that provides a flexible, easy-to-use interface to create and manage your email campaigns and to evaluate your message deliverability and campaign performance.

The UI supports the following browsers:

*   Firefox

*   Internet Explorer, versions 9 and 10

It supports the current and previous major releases of these browsers on a rolling basis. Each time a new version is released, the UI will begin supporting that version and stop supporting the third most recent version. All browsers must have cookies and JavaScript enabled. The UI is viewed best with a screen resolution of at least 1200 pixels wide. When viewed at lower resolutions, the built-in responsive design ability will adjust the layout as though displaying on a tablet device.

**Getting Started with the UI** 

Open the UI by pointing your web browser at the appropriate IP address and log in using your credentials. If you do not know the IP address, contact your system administrator.

Your UI opens in the SUMMARY section under REPORTS, as shown in [Figure 2.2, “User Interface”](getting.started.ui.php#figure_summary_1 "Figure 2.2. User Interface"). It supports your native language by setting the rules for date format, number format, and sorting based on the language set in your browser.
