## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## 4.4. Database Maintenance

In normal circumstances there is no need to perform database maintenance.

You should not normally ever delete any records in the database. Contact the support team, if you feel the need to remove data of *any* kind.

One thing you can do on occasion is use the VACUUM utility. This process reclaims space and makes it available for reuse. At the very least it can help improve response time and database efficiency. Use the VACUUM utility in the following way:

```
shell> /opt/msys/3rdParty/bin/psql -U msyspg ecelerity
pe=# VACUUM FULL ANALYZE;
```
