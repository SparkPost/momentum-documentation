## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## 3.7. Creating Users

Adding users makes sense once you have decided on the specific roles that are required.

Once a user is created you can assign one or more roles to that user. If a specific role provides too few or too many permissions you can add a role to a user and then remove or add individual permissions. If need be, you can add permissions one by one rather than by using roles.

Adding users through the web UI is described in detail in ["Users"](https://support.messagesystems.com/docs/web-mc-user/mc3-administration-users.php).
