## Name

starttls_injection_policy — protect against SMTP injections prior to TLS

## Synopsis

`Starttls_Injection_Policy = "allow|ignore|reject"`

<a name="idp26762976"></a>
## Description

This option deals with the security issue described by CVE-2011-0411, namely that SMTP commands can be injected before the MTA switches to TLS. Consequently, a "man in the middle" could inject SMTP commands that are not protected by TLS.

This option can be set to the following:

*   `allow` – The ESMTP listener will process commands after STARTTLS and before successful SSL negotiation.

*   `ignore` – Any commands after STARTTLS are ignored, and commands after the successful TLS negotiation will be interpreted.

*   `reject` – If any commands are present in the buffer immediately after a STARTTLS command, the STARTTLS is rejected and the connection is dropped. This event will be logged in the rejectlog.

The default value is `reject`.

## Scope

`starttls_injection_policy` is valid in the ESMTP_Listener, listen, pathway, pathway_group and peer scopes.
