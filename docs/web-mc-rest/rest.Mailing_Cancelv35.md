## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## Name

Mailing_Cancelv35 — The Mailing_Cancel API cancels the given mailing and on success returns `0`.

<a name="idp823632"></a>
## Description

The Mailing_Cancel API cancels the given mailing by changing the mailing state to 'Completed'. It returns `0` if successful.

When a mailing in the Edit, Ready, Completed, or Archive state is canceled, this API returns success. The mailings in Edit or Ready are moved to Completed. If a mailing is in-process, generation stops. The mailings in a Completed or Archive state do not change.

Errors are generated by the Cancel action if there are invalid mailing or organization ids. The former returns a response "no such mailing" and name:INVALID_MAILING, while the latter returns "Invalid schema name" and name:"Database Error".

## Supported Actions

*   Issue a POST or PUT request in the following ways.

    `PUT /v3.5/mailing/cancel?orgid=2&mid=123`

    Cancels the mailing identified by the input parameters. Returns `0` on success.

    The PUT/POST payload is expected to be either valid mailing object or required parameters orgid and mid, either as JSON payload or as HTML-form style parameters.

    `PUT /v3.5/mailing/cancel?orgid=2&mid=123,124,125,126`

    Cancels all of the mailings provided as input parameters and issues an error on failure.

    It is not possible to issue a GET on /v3.5/mailing/cancel. It is not possible to issue a DELETE on /v3.5/mailing/cancel.
