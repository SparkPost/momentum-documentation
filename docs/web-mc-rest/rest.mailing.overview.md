## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## Chapter 10. Mailing

## The Mailing Object Definition

If you install the Message Central web UI there is a default campaign with the id of `1`. If the web UI is not installed there is no default campaign so you must create a campaign before you can create a mailing.

For details of the Mailing structure see [Section 25.15, “mailing”](rest.autogen.struct.mailing.php "25.15. mailing").

if you wish to use Intelligent Message Disposition With a mailing that is generated by the mailing API, see [Intelligent Message Disposition](https://support.messagesystems.com/docs/web-mc/mc-post-installation.imd.php).

### Note

When creating a mailing, you cannot set its "approved" property to `true`; its initial state is always "created". (See [Section 26.8, “mailingstates”](rest.autogen.map.mailingstates.php "26.8. mailingstates") for a list of all possible mailing states.) Before a mailing can be sent out, its state must be update to "approved". Also, if the campaign that the mailing is associated with is set to require approval, then a mailing will not be eligible for generation until the approved property is set to `true` *and* the mailingstate is also changed to "approved".

In the web UI it is possible to send a test message. (See [https://support.messagesystems.com/docs/web-mc-user/mc3-content-previewing.php](https://support.messagesystems.com/docs/web-mc-user/mc3-content-previewing.php).) There is no such capability in the REST API.

Use the following API endpoints to enumerate, create and fetch mailing-related information.

*   `GET /v1.0/mailing?orgid=2`

    Enumerates the set of mailings in the system.

    This API returns an array of short Mailing objects. This array may be ordered, formatted or limited as described in [Section 7.7, “Query Restrictions”](rest.query.restrictions.php "7.7. Query Restrictions").

*   `GET /v1.0/mailing?orgid=2&mid=1`

    This API returns a short Mailing object describing the specified mailing. If the Mailing object is not found a "404 Not Found" status is returned.

*   `GET /v1.0/mailing?orgid=2&mid=1&full=true`

    This API returns a fully populated Mailing object describing the specified mailing. If the Mailing object is not found a "404 Not Found" status is returned.

*   `DELETE /v1.0/mailing?orgid=2&mid=1`

    Deletes the specified mailing.

*   `PUT /v1.0/mailing?orgid=2`

    `POST /v1.0/mailing?orgid=2`

    Creates a new mailing object.

The following examples show a subset of the allowed properties; consult [Section 25.15, “mailing”](rest.autogen.struct.mailing.php "25.15. mailing") for a full listing of properties.

```
PUT /v1.0/mailing Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
orgid=2&type=api-triggered&name=Example+Mailing?campaign=Campaign+Test+ABCD
```

```
PUT /v1.0/mailing?orgid=2 Content-Type: application/json
{
    "type": "api-triggered",
    "name": "Example Mailing",
    "campaign": "Campaign Test ABCD"
}
```

### Note

Do *not* use commas in mailing names. Doing this can create problems when the mailing state is changed to `ready`.

## Updating a Mailing

When updating a mailing, if the modifiedDate in what you PUT or POST does not match the value on the server side, your PUT or POST will fail with the message `409 Conflict` giving the response `modifiedDate: null`. When using PUT or POST with the mailing API, if modifiedDate is not present, the API will try to create a new mailing. This is true for all objects that have a modifiedDate field.

The easiest way to update an existing mailing is to use the read-modify-write sequence described in [Example 7.1, “REST read-modify-write example”](rest.input.parameters.php#rest.post.put.read "Example 7.1. REST read-modify-write example").
