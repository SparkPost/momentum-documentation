## Name

max_resident_active_queue — threshold above which messages are not held in memory

## Synopsis

`max_resident_active_queue = 250`

<a name="idp25380496"></a>
## Description

The maximum number of messages in a domain's active queue before certain destaging actions should be taken to prevent them from consuming excessive system memory. This option is very useful for domains that practice tarpitting. A value of ‘`-1`’ deactivates this setting and a value of ‘`0`’ makes the system drop all resident messages in the queue. The default value is `250`. Reasonable non-zero values are between 500 and 10000, depending on system memory.

### Warning

This is an advanced option. Setting this option to small non-zero values can have deleterious effects on performance. Thorough testing is recommended prior to deployment in a production environment.
