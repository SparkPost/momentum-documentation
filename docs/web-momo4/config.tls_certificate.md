## Synopsis

`TLS_Certificate = "/path/to/cert"`

<a name="idp26954464"></a>
## Description

Specifies the filename of a file containing a PEM encoded certificate that Momentum should present to remote mail exchanges (it is a client certificate). The file may contain both a certificate and a key.

The special value `none` can be used to indicate that no certificate file should be used. This is useful to explicitly avoid using a certificate when a parent scope defines one.
