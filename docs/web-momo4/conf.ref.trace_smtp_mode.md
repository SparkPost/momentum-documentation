## Name

trace_smtp_mode â€” set the default permissions of trace files

## Synopsis

`trace_smtp_mode = 0640`

<a name="idp27162256"></a>
## Description

This option sets the default permissions of trace files created when using the console command **trace smtp** . As always, the permissions will be modified by the umask of the ecelerity process. When running as user and group `ecuser`, the default value will make the files readable and writable to the `ecuser` user, readable to members of the ecuser group, and not accessible to other users.

Changing the value of this option at runtime requires restarting the ecelerity process (issuing the ec_console command **`config reload`**         will not suffice).

The default value is `0640`.
