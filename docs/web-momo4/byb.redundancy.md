## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## 6.3. Redundancy

Should any nodes fail, you need a [Quorum](glossary.php#gloss.quorum "Quorum") within both your Platform and Analytics servers in order for Momentum to continue functioning properly. For Momentum, you have a quorum when more than 50% of nodes are active. What constitutes a quorum has implications for redundancy. For example, you cannot support redundancy with only two Platform and two Analytics nodes. Should any one node go down, you will not have the 51% required for a quorum. So, for high availability, the most efficient cluster sizes will be odd numbers of three or more Platform nodes *and* three or more Analytics nodes.
