## Description

The amount of time in seconds to wait for a response once the `DATA` phase has been terminated by a `CRLF.CRLF`. This timeout is relatively long because this is the only phase of transmission which involves significant network transmission. This option applies to outbound mail only.

The default value is `600`.
