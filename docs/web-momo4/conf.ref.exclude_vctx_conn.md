## Name

exclude_vctx_conn â€” exclude validation context keys from being journaled in the spool metadata.

## Synopsis

`Exclude_VCTX_Conn = ("regex$" "otherregex")`

<a name="idp24645824"></a>
## Description

With more advanced policy configurations, the aggregate size of the validation context data retained in memory may become significant, especially if `keep_message_dicts_in_memory` is enabled.

`Exclude_VCTX_Conn` allows you to specify a list of one or more Perl-compatible regular expressions. During swap out, the keys to the connection dictionary are compared against the patterns listed by `Exclude_VCTX_Conn`. If a key matches, then that data value will be deleted from the dictionary.

Note that keys that have special significance to the core product (these typically have a `#` prefix) can not be filtered by this module.

Exclude_VCTX_Conn is valid in the global, binding, binding_group, and domain scopes.
