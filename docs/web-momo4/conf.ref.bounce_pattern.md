## Name

bounce_pattern — configure the pattern that inbound email addresses must match in order to be considered bounces.

## Synopsis

`Bounce_Pattern = "Perl-compatible regular expression"`

<a name="idp23754336"></a>
## Description

When a message passed through the server bounces due to an in-band SMTP failure or is received out-of-band as a notification of failed delivery, this option will qualify the "original sending" email address as suitable for bounce classification and processing. For in-band bounces, the "original sending" email address is the envelope sender. For out-of-band delivery failures the "original sending" address is the envelope recipient. The ultimate behavior of bounce handling is dictated by the the `Bounce_Behavior` configuration setting.

If you leave the `Bounce_Pattern` setting unconfigured, then any mail to any of the `Bounce_Domains` will be considered a bounce, and processed as such.

To treat all mails originally sent from an email address like bounces-####-###@bounces.example.com as eligible for bounce processing, you would specify:

```
Bounce_Domains = ( bounces.example.com )
Bounce_Pattern = "^bounces-\d+-\d+@"
```
