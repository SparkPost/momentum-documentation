## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## 25.7. Outbound Email Relay

When configuring Momentum as an outbound e-mail relay, you must take care to not expose your system to abuse by allowing unauthorized machines to send e-mail to domains for which the local instance does not provide mail service. Doing so makes your system an "open relay." Only trusted machines should be allowed to connect and inject mails. The `relay_hosts` option controls this setting. For details, see [relay_hosts](conf.ref.relay_hosts.php "relay_hosts").
