## Description

**ec_sendmail** is a command line utility for Unix systems that requires a local binary to perform submission to the local MTA.

It has the following options:

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>-F *`full_name`*</dt>

<dd>

Set sender's full name. This will be displayed in the From: header.

</dd>

<dt>-f *`email_address`*</dt>

<dd>

Specify the MAIL FROM: part on the envelope. This address is also displayed in the From: header. If `-f` is used to specify a different address other than the actual `username@hostname` by a user who is not root or whose `geteuid()` doesn't return 0, a `X-Authentication-Warning` header will be added in the email.

</dd>

<dt>-h</dt>

<dd>

Show a help message.

</dd>

<dt>-i</dt>

<dd>

Ignore lines containing only a single dot. It is recommended to set this if data is read from a file.

</dd>

<dt>-t</dt>

<dd>

Scanning the message for recipient(s). Lines starting with To:, Cc: or Bcc: will be used to extract recipient address(es).

</dd>

</dl>
