## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## 71.26. delay_dsn – Delay DSN Generation

<a class="indexterm" name="idp21212928"></a>

The delay_dsn module allows delivery status notifications (DSNs) to be sent to the purported sender of a message, when that message has not yet been delivered.

By default, no delay DSNs are sent. When enabled, delay DSNs are sent based on an exponential back-off schedule. The schedule is independent of the schedule used for delivery attempts. Delay DSNs are sent as RFC 3464-compliant messages.

### 71.26.1. Configuration

Sending of delay DSNs and the schedules can be configured in various scopes. If further customization is required, there are a number of hooks available. These hooks can be used to achieve: different types of schedules, such as every N hours instead of exponential back-off; customization of the message content; and finer-grained control over to who delay DSNs are sent.

The following is an example configuration:

<a name="example.delay_dsn.3"></a>

**Example 71.42. delay_dsn module**

```
delay_dsn "delay_dsn1" { }

generate_delay_dsn = "true"

# don't generate delay dsns for mail from foo.com
domain "foo.com" {
  generate_delay_dsn = "false"
}

domain "bar.com" {
  # custom delay dsn schedule. send a delay dsn on 3 hours, then 9 hours
  # (6 hours after 3 hours), 21 hours (12 hours after 9 hours),
  # 45 hours (24 hours after 21 hours), then every 24 hours
  # (maximum interval).
  delay_dsn_retry_interval = 10800
  delay_dsn_max_retry_interval = 86400
}
```

### 71.26.2. Console Commands

The delay_dsn module can be controlled through the `ec_console`. The following command is available:

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>delay_dsn:*`delay_dsn1`* show pending events</dt>

<dd>

This command lists all pending events.

</dd>

</dl>
