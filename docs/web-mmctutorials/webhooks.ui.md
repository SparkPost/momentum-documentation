## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## Chapter 16. Managing Webhooks using the UI

**Introduction**

In addition to using the Webhooks API, you can create and manage webhooks in the web-based User Interface (UI). The UI provides a flexible, easy-to-use interface to view details about your webhooks, create new webhooks, test and update existing webhooks, and delete webhooks you no longer need.

A batch of event data transmitted to a webhook consists of one or more event records, each composed of a payload wrapped in a type-specific envelope as described for each event type. Each event record payload includes the data fields specific to that event type. To create a webhook that meets your specific requirements, you must understand the events being posted to the webhook. Before creating a webhook, review the section on **Determining the Available Event Types**                           in the tutorial [Chapter 15, *Using Webhooks for Event Data*](getting.started.webhooks.php "Chapter 15. Using Webhooks for Event Data") .

### Note

For this tutorial, you will need a web browser to access the UI. The UI supports Firefox and Internet Explorer, version 9 and 10. All browsers must have cookies and JavaScript enabled.

**Creating a Webhook Using the UI** 

Follow these steps to create a webhook in the UI:

1.  Open the UI by pointing your web browser at the appropriate IP address and log in using your credentials. If you do not know the IP address, contact your system administrator.

    <a name="figure_login_4"></a>

    **Figure 16.1. Login**

    ![Login](images/login.png)

2.  Click ACCOUNT in the left navigation panel, and then click Webhooks to open the Webhooks area, as shown in [Figure 16.2, “Webhooks”](webhooks.ui.php#figure_webhooks_icon "Figure 16.2. Webhooks").

    <a name="figure_webhooks_icon"></a>

    **Figure 16.2. Webhooks**

    ![Webhooks](images/webhooks_icon.png)

3.  In the Webhooks area, click NEW WEBHOOK to open the form to create a new webhook, as shown in [Figure 16.3, “Create New Webhook”](webhooks.ui.php#figure_new_webhook "Figure 16.3. Create New Webhook").

    <a name="figure_new_webhook"></a>

    **Figure 16.3. Create New Webhook**

    ![Create New Webhook](images/new_webhook_form.png)

4.  Enter the following information in the form: (Note: An asterisk (*) denotes the required fields.)

    *   Webhook Name* - User-friendly name for the webhook, only used for display

    *   Target URL* - URL of the target to which to post data

    *   Authentication Token - (optional) Authentication token to present in the X-MessageSystems-Webhook-Token header of POST requests to the target URL

        Use this token in your target application to confirm that data is coming from your webhook.

5.  Select the event types that will trigger the webhook. To receive all event types on the webhook, click ALL. If you want only select event types, click SELECT and select from the list displayed, as shown in [Figure 16.4, “Event Types”](webhooks.ui.php#figure_event_types "Figure 16.4. Event Types").

    <a name="figure_event_types"></a>

    **Figure 16.4. Event Types**

    ![Event Types](images/event_types.png)

    **Coming Soon. ** Relay Events is a new feature that will be available soon.

    When complete, click ADD WEBHOOK to create your new webhook.

6.  On creation, a test POST is sent to the target URL for validation. If this request does not receive an HTTP 200 response, the webhook will not be created, and you will receive a validation error.

    If the test POST is successful, the following message will display. Click the x to close the message. The events that you selected will begin to be posted to the target URL after a 1 minute activation time.

    <a name="figure_created_webhook"></a>

    **Figure 16.5. Woohoo!**

    ![Woohoo!](images/webhook_created.png)

**Testing Your Webhook** 

In addition to the validation performed when you create your webhook, you can test your webhook by posting an example message event batch to the target URL. The test sends an HTTP request to the client endpoint in the same way that the batch transmitter will. This test will validate that the target responds with an "OK" (i.e. HTTP 200) and return a detailed information response.

Follow these steps to test an existing webhook:

1.  In the Webhooks area, click the TEST icon to the right of the webhook that you want to test, as shown in [Figure 16.6, “Test Webhook”](webhooks.ui.php#figure_test_webhook "Figure 16.6. Test Webhook").

    <a name="figure_test_webhook"></a>

    **Figure 16.6. Test Webhook**

    ![Test Webhook](images/webhooks_list.png)

2.  The test request that will be sent to your webhook target URL is displayed, as shown in [Figure 16.7, “Test Request”](webhooks.ui.php#figure_test_request "Figure 16.7. Test Request"). The window shows the full content of the HTTP request, which is exactly the same as what the batch transmitter would send to the client endpoint. To continue with the test, click SEND TEST BATCH.

    <a name="figure_test_request"></a>

    **Figure 16.7. Test Request**

    ![Test Request](images/test_request.png)

3.  The test returns the response from your server, as shown in [Figure 16.8, “Test Response”](webhooks.ui.php#figure_test_response "Figure 16.8. Test Response").

    <a name="figure_test_response"></a>

    **Figure 16.8. Test Response**

    ![Test Response](images/test_response.png)

    The response shows the full content of the HTTP response sent by the client endpoint after receiving the test request. It includes a standard HTTP status. In the example response, the "OK" (`HTTP/1.1 200`) indicates that the example message event batch was successfully posted to the target URL. Any other response code indicates some type of error.

    When complete, click CANCEL to return to the main Webhooks area.

**Modifying Your Webhook** 

You can edit any configuration option of an existing webhook.

Follow these steps to modify an existing webhook:

1.  In the Webhooks area, click the EDIT icon to the right of the webhook that you want to modify, as shown in [Figure 16.9, “Update Webhook”](webhooks.ui.php#figure_update_webhook "Figure 16.9. Update Webhook").

    <a name="figure_update_webhook"></a>

    **Figure 16.9. Update Webhook**

    ![Update Webhook](images/webhooks_list.png)

2.  Make your changes in the form shown in [Figure 16.10, “Update Webhook”](webhooks.ui.php#figure_edit_webhook "Figure 16.10. Update Webhook"), and then click UPDATE WEBHOOK.

    <a name="figure_edit_webhook"></a>

    **Figure 16.10. Update Webhook**

    ![Update Webhook](images/edit_webhook.png)

3.  If the webhook successfully updates, the following message will display. Click the x to close the message.

    <a name="figure_updated_webhook"></a>

    **Figure 16.11. Webhook updated!**

    ![Webhook updated!](images/updated_webhook.png)

    Batches currently queued for delivery to this webhook will not be affected by these modifications. For example: If you change the webhook’s target URL, batches already queued for delivery will still be posted to the previous URL. Also if you update the target URL, a test POST will be sent to the URL for validation.

**Deleting a Webhook** 

If you no longer need a webhook, you can delete an existing webhook in the UI.

Follow these steps to delete an existing webhook:

1.  In the Webhooks area, click the trash can icon to the right of the webhook that you want to delete, as shown in [Figure 16.12, “Delete Webhook”](webhooks.ui.php#figure_delete_webhook "Figure 16.12. Delete Webhook").

    <a name="figure_delete_webhook"></a>

    **Figure 16.12. Delete Webhook**

    ![Delete Webhook](images/webhooks_list.png)

2.  A warning message will display, as shown in [Figure 16.13, “Confirm Delete”](webhooks.ui.php#figure_confirm_delete_webhook "Figure 16.13. Confirm Delete"). To confirm your request, click DELETE.

    <a name="figure_confirm_delete_webhook"></a>

    **Figure 16.13. Confirm Delete**

    ![Confirm Delete](images/confirm_delete_webhook.png)

3.  If the webhook is successfully deleted, the following message will display. Click the x to close the message.

    <a name="figure_deleted_webhook"></a>

    **Figure 16.14. Success!**

    ![Success!](images/deleted_webhook.png)

    The system will stop posting data to the target URL after the batches currently queued to be delivered are drained.
