## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## Glossary

<dl>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.ab.split"></a>A/B Split Mailing</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

Using an A/B Split mailing is a way to test content or subject line without having to set up two separate mailings. Once two or more test segments, the content items, the wait period, and the winning statistics (either clicks or opens) are set up, the A/B Split Mailing will automatically send out the winning content to the remainder of the list.

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.api.triggered"></a>API-triggered Mailing</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

An API-triggered mailing is a mailing that is never built, but is continually evaluated to see if recipients have been pushed to it via the API. When they have been pushed, mail is generated for those recipients. You may not use the UI to add recipients to an API-triggered mailing, because it is API-triggered, not UI-triggered.

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.csv"></a>Comma-Separated Values (CSV)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

CSV is one of the input and output options available for the REST API and the Message Central web UI. See also [JavaScript Object Notation](mc3-glossary.php#mc3.gloss.json "JavaScript Object Notation").

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.direct.access"></a>Direct Access Mailing</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A direct access mailing is a special case of a scheduled mailing. In a direct access mailing the recipients are selected from a data source that is external to Message Central. In this mode you are required to write your own SQL queries to select the recipients. Data goes directly to the Message Central generators but transient records are created in the Message Central database. For more information see [Section 5.3.3.1, “Direct Access Mailing”](mc3-mailings-editing.php#mc3-mailings-direct-access "5.3.3.1. Direct Access Mailing").

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.esp"></a>Email Service Provider (ESP)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A company that provides email services. Message Central lets an ESP set up a different Org for each client.

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.immediate"></a>Immediate Mailing</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

An immediate mailing is a special case of a scheduled mailing. Both are used to set up a mailing that will build and generate only once.

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.imported.list"></a>Imported List</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A list of recipients, generated by some external source, imported into Message Central for mailing. An Imported List is assumed to be imported through the Web UI, unless otherwise indicated.

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.json"></a>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

JSON is a lightweight data interchange format. It is one of the input and output options available for the REST API. See also [Comma-Separated Values](mc3-glossary.php#mc3.gloss.csv "Comma-Separated Values").

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.lifecycle.campaign"></a>Life-Cycle Campaign</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A group of mailings that together have the goal of driving the recipient to take an action or set of actions. In a lifecycle campaign, the mailings are generally (though not always) triggered either by some action or inaction on the part of the recipient (has opened or has not clicked, for example) or by a time-related element (send if no action by recipient after 30 days; send seven days after purchase).

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.lifecycle.mailing"></a>Life-Cycle Mailing</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A mailing that is part of a [Life-Cycle Campaign](mc3-glossary.php#mc3.gloss.lifecycle.campaign "Life-Cycle Campaign").

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.list"></a>List</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A set of criteria that defines a group of recipients.

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.mta"></a>Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.mass.mailing"></a>Mass Mailing</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.prce"></a>Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A C regular expression library modelled on the Perl regular expression library. This library is incorporated into a number of open-source projects.

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.recurring"></a>Recurring Mailing</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A recurring mailing is a cloned mailing that is repeated on a fixed schedule. A clone is built and generated for each mailing. For example, if you have an hourly recurring mailing, every hour, the parent is cloned, and a mailing generated. For the second mailing the parent is cloned and the mailing generated and so on for the remaining mailings.

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.rest"></a>Representational State Transfer (REST)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

Web services available over HTTP. In Message Central the REST API replaces the original SOAP API. Using REST you can interact with Message Central programmatically.

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.rfc"></a>Request For Comment (RFC)</dt>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.rfc2047"></a>RFC2047 - MIME</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

The standard for message header extensions for non-ASCII text. See also [Request For Comment](mc3-glossary.php#mc3.gloss.rfc "Request For Comment").

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.scheduled"></a>Scheduled Mailing</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A mailing that is scheduled to run at a specific time.

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.segment"></a>Segment</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A segment is a subset of the recipients of a List. Segments are usually used in order to send different content to different subsets of a mailing. Using Message Central you can define a single mailing that targets different audiences who recieve unique content.

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.test.list"></a>Test list</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A test list is a list of recipients created for the purpose of sending previews and other test messages. Test lists behave the same way as other lists except that *only* test lists appear in the Preview tab when previewing content. For more information see [Section 7.4, “Previewing Content”](mc3-content-previewing.php "7.4. Previewing Content").

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc-toast"></a>The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique (TOAST)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

In PostgreSQL it is not possible to store large fields directly. TOAST is the technique used to break up large fields over multiple rows. Creating any PostgreSQL database creates a `pg_toast` schema for handling large field values.

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.transactional.mailing"></a>Transactional Mailing</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A transactional mailing is one that is triggered by a recipient's interaction with a website or other system. Examples include a shipping confirmation, a password reset email, or a purchase confirmation. Triggers can be behavioral or result from a change in the recipient's data, for example, a recipient's loyalty status change. Typically this is a one-to-one message.

</dd>

<dt><a name="mc3.gloss.verp"></a>Variable Envelope Return Path (VERP)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

This technique specifies a different return path for every email making it possible to associate bounced email with a specific sender so that invalid addresses can be removed from mailing lists. For more information see ["RFC 3464"](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3464).
