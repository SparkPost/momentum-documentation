## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## 1.2. Logging in to the Web UI

To log in to the web UI, point your browser at the appropriate URL. When you log in for the first time you must use the admin credentials created during installation. The username is `admin` and the password is the password that was assigned to this user.

### Note

Internet Explorer 8 and Firefox 3.6.10 (or higher) are the only browsers supported for use with the Message Central web UI.

As of version 3.7, Internet Explorer 9 is supported.

The admin user is a superuser so all menus and options are available to this user. Depending upon their permissions, other users may only have limited access to the web UI.

If Message Central has more than one org, after entering your credentials you must choose the org that you wish to log in to. If you are not a superuser, you may not be able to log in to all orgs. For more information about a user's permissions see [Section 11.2, “Users”](mc3-administration-users.php "11.2. Users").
