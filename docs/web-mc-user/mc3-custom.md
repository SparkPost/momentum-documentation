## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## Chapter 10. Custom Apps

The CUSTOM APPS menu shows applications that add to the existing functionality of Message Central. For example, you may wish to create custom reports and make them available through the web UI.

Custom applications added to Message Central appear as submenus under the CUSTOM APPS menu item. Custom applications also appear as permissions that may be added to a role. For information about adding permissions see [Section C.2, “All Permissions”](mc3-role-all-permissions.php "C.2. All Permissions").

Message Central ships with the sample custom application `Hello World`. To determine how to write a custom application look at the "Hello World" application in the `/opt/msys/pe2/webui/application/modules/custom/controllers/sample` directory on the machine that hosts the Message Central web UI. For more details on creating a custom application see ["Building a Custom Application"](https://support.messagesystems.com/docs/web-mc/mc3.custom.application.php).
