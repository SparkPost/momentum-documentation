<a name="idp13023952"></a>
## Description

**adaptivedb** creates the SQLite database used by the adaptive module. The database is named `adaptive.db` and is located in the `/var/log/ecelerity` directory. After issuing this command, you should see the message, "Adaptive Database created".

This command initializes the data store used by the adaptive module. You *must* run this command if you plan to use the adaptive module.

**Configuration Change. ** As of version 3.3, this command is no longer used. When upgrading to Momentum 3.3, use the command [ec_admigrate](executable.ec_admigrate "ec_admigrate") to migrate the SQLite database to the Riak database used in Momentum 3.3 and higher.
