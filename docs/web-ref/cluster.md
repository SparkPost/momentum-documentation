The clustering capabilities of the product enable the following features:
*   Centralized management of configuration for multiple MTA nodes
*   Replicated, redundant, configuration repository with revision control
*   Log aggregation pulls log files from MTA nodes to centralized location(s) on the network
*   Replication of a variety of real-time metrics to allow cluster-wide coordination for inbound and outbound traffic shaping
*   DuraVIP™, our IP Failover mechanism.
Clustering is based on the concept of having a cluster of machines that communicate using a group communication message bus. Ideally, a cluster will have a dedicated gigabit network for transmission of replicated data and internal message moves.
The product assumes that the cluster network is a trusted network, meaning that it leaves host based authentication to be implemented by the network administrator at an appropriate firewall on the network.
