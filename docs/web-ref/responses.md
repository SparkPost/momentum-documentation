## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## Message Responses

**Table of Contents**

<dl class="toc">

<dt>[F.1\. Responses Sorted By Codes](responses-by-code.php)</dt>

<dt>[F.2\. Responses Sorted by Message](responses-by-message.php)</dt>

</dl>

This appendix lists the various responses that may be returned by the MTA when attempting delivery. Where applicable an explanation of the response is provided. If a response is marked "[internal]", this usually indicates that the message did not originate with an external host but from the MTA itself. Messages so marked usually appear in the transient and permanent failure logs.

Responses are first sorted by code and then alphabetically by the message.
