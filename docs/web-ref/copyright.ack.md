## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.
