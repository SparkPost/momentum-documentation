The binary packages are designed for easy installation. Each platform uses its native installation format (`RPM` for Linux, `pkg` for Solaris). All installations have identical installation paths, so no path translations are required in this section.
The supported platforms are as follows:
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (x86_64)
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (i386)
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (x86_64) (As of version 3.4.)
*   Solaris 10 (amd64)
*   Solaris 10 (sparcv9)
### Note
Message Systems only supports 64-bit environments for Momentum 3.6.x and later.
### Note
Please unset the following environmental variables before installing or upgrading:
*   unset `LC_MONETARY`
*   unset `LC_NUMERIC`
*   unset `LC_MESSAGES`
*   unset `LC_COLLATE`
*   unset `LC_CTYPE`
*   unset `LC_TIME`
The variables are sometimes set by your terminal program, by iTerm for Mac OS X, for example. Also, make sure that the following variable is set:
`LANG=en_US.UTF-8`
This is especially important for upgrades from 3.2.x to 3.3.x.
The expected installation path is `/opt/msys/ecelerity`: If you choose to move this installation to a different final location we recommend soft linking `/opt/msys/ecelerity` to that location.
If you are upgrading to Momentum version 3.3, be sure to review [Section 4.3.1, “PostgreSQL in Momentum Version 3.3”](operations.postgresql#operations.postgresql.migrating.3.3 "4.3.1. PostgreSQL in Momentum Version 3.3").
## Supported Versions in Momentum 3.5.4
*   Red Hat 5.9 (and its CentOS equivalent) on both i386 and x86-64 architectures
*   Red Hat 6.4 (and its CentOS equivalent) on x86-64 architecture
*   Solaris variants: Solaris 10 (minimum level U3) on both SPARC and AMD64 architectures
*   Note that Momentum 3.5 and future releases are not supported on Red Hat 4\. Red Hat dropped support for this release in February 2012.
