## 3.1. Starting the Web Console

The web console is configured to start automatically as a service on the machine where it is installed.

If you did not start the web console immediately after installation you can start it up as a service by issuing the command, **`/etc/init.d/ecwebconsole start`**       . Doing this starts up the `httpd` daemon. `restart` and `stop` are also valid options with **ecwebconsole**.
