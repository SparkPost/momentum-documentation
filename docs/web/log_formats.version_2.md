## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## C.1. Log Formats for Version 2.1 and 2.2

This section documents the log formats used in Momentum versions 2.1 and 2.2.

### C.1.1. The `mainlog.ec`

The `mainlog.ec` file logs reception, delivery, transient failure, permanent failure and heartbeat events. The log entry format differs depending upon the event type. The different formats are described in the following sections.

**C.1.1.1. Reception Records Version 2.2**

Every reception that Momentum performs is written to the `mainlog.ec` file as a single line as shown in the example below.

`1064868656@00/00-25004-31B987F3@R@bob@example.fict@info@postalengine.com@10.0.1.1@201@esmtp@default@default`

As with all log file entries, the fields are delimited by `@` signs. The fields are:

<a name="log_formats.reception.record.fields"></a>

**Table C.1. Reception record fields**

| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1064868656 | The date of reception in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | 00/00-25004-31B987F3 | The message's message-id. This is a unique value per message. This also corresponds with its location on disk. |
| 2 | R | R is how you know it is a reception. |
| 3 | bob | The localpart of the recipient. |
| 4 | example.fict | The domain of the recipient. |
| 5 | info | The localpart of the envelope sender. |
| 6 | postalengine.com | The domain of the envelope sender. |
| 7 | 10.0.1.1 | The IP address the message was received from. |
| 8 | 201 | The size of the message in bytes. |
| 9 | esmtp | The protocol the message was received over (either esmtp or ecstream). If the message was transferred from another node, the "protocol" will be `xfr`. The value `internal` indicates an internally generated bounce or a message generated by Sieve. |
| 10 | default | The MultiVIP® binding group that the message was assigned to. |
| 11 | default | The MultiVIP® binding that the message was assigned to. |

**C.1.1.2. Delivery Records Version 2.2**

A delivery line is written to `mainlog.ec` for every message that is delivered by Momentum. The line is an `@` delimited string such as the following:

`1064871280@20/00-25593-945A87F3@D@postalengine.com@266@group-a@binding-a@0@0.393@10.0.0.1`

A description of the fields follows:

<a name="log_formats.delivery.record.fields"></a>

| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1064871280 | The date of delivery in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | 20/00-25593-945A87F3 | The message's message-id. This is a unique value per message. |
| 2 | D | D marks this line as a successful delivery. |

| 8 | 0.393 | The amount of time the message spent in queue before being delivered. |
| 9 | 10.0.0.1 | The IP address that accepted the message. |

**C.1.1.3. Transient Failure Records Version 2.2**

A transient failure is a failure which allows retry of the same message. The ec_logger module allows for optional logging of transient failures.

A transient failure line is an `@` delimited string like the following:

`1064869327@00/00-25593-CBD987F3@T@example.fict@0@group-a@binding-a@15@0@18.53@10.0.0.1@421 no adequate servers`

| 2 | T | T marks this log line as a transient failure. |
| 3 | example.fict | The destination domain. |
| 4 | 0 | The number of bytes of data transferred before the failure occurred. Since no connection could be made for bob@example.fict (it's a bogus domain), 0 bytes where transferred. |
| 5 | group-a | The MultiVIP® binding group for this message. |
| 6 | binding-a | The MultiVIP® binding for this message. |
| 7 | 15 | The stage of the message. Stage descriptions can be found at [Section C.3, “Connection Stages”](log_formats.connection.stages.php "C.3. Connection Stages"). |
| 8 | 0 | The number of times the message has been retried. Since this was the initial attempt, the value is 0. |
| 9 | 18.53 | The total time the message has spent in queue in seconds. |
| 10 | 10.0.0.1 | The IP address of the server which rejected the message. |
| 11 | 421 no adequate servers | The error message associated with the failure. |

**C.1.1.4. Permanent Failure Records Version 2.2**

A permanent failure indicates that the message that was attempted failed in such a way that it should not be retried further. After logging a permanent failure the message will be discarded.

A permanent failure line is an '@' delimited string like the following:

`1064870847@10/00-25593-393A87F3@P@postalengine.com@31@group-a@binding-a@5@1@3.89@10.0.0.1@552 No such account`

| 11 | 552 No such account | The error message returned from the remote host. |

**C.1.1.5. Heartbeat Records Version 2.2**

A heartbeat is written periodically to the log, to indicate that Momentum is still active and may log further data. The heartbeats are used by the web console for real-time reporting.

`1191248269@@M`

A description of the fields follows:

<a name="log_formats.heartbeat.record.fields"></a>

**Table C.5. Heartbeat record fields**

### C.1.2. The mainlog.ec 2.1 Format

### Note

This section documents the mainlog.ec format for version *2.1*. For the mainlog.ec format for version 2.2 see [Section C.1.1, “The `mainlog.ec`”](log_formats.version_2.php#log_formats.mainlog "C.1.1. The mainlog.ec")

The `mainlog.ec` file logs reception, delivery, transient failure, permanent failure and heartbeat events. The log entry format differs depending upon the event type.

**C.1.2.1. Reception Records 2.1 Format**

Every reception that Momentum performs is written to the `mainlog.ec` file as a single line as shown in the example below.

`1064868656@00/00-25004-31B987F3@R@bob@example.fict@info@postalengine.com@10.0.1.1@201@esmtp@default`

As all `mainlog.ec` entries, the fields are delimited by `@` signs. The fields are:

<a name="idp24128864"></a>

**Table C.6. Reception record fields**

| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1064868656 | The date of reception in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | 00/00-25004-31B987F3 | The message's message-id. This is a unique value per message. This also corresponds with its location on disk. |

**C.1.2.3. Transient Failure Records 2.1 Format**

A transient failure is a failure which allows retry of the same message. The ec_logger module allows for optional logging of transient failures. Since they are not permanent failures and only indicate that a message will be attempted later due to temporary problems, many users opt to disable them to conserve log space. A transient failure line is an `@` delimited string like the following:

`1064869327@00/00-25593-CBD987F3@T@example.fict@0@default@15@0@18.53@421 no adequate servers`

A description of the fields follows:

| 2 | T | T marks this log line as a transient failure. |
| 3 | example.fict | The destination domain. |
| 4 | 0 | The number of bytes of data transferred before the failure occurred. Since no connection could be made for bob@example.fict (it's a bogus domain), 0 bytes where transferred. |
| 5 | default | The MultiVIP® binding for this message. |
| 6 | 15 | The stage of the message. Stage descriptions can be found at [Section C.3, “Connection Stages”](log_formats.connection.stages.php "C.3. Connection Stages"). |
| 7 | 0 | The number of times the message has been retried. Since this was the initial attempt, the value is 0. |
| 8 | 18.53 | The total time the message has spent in queue in seconds. |
| 9 | 421 no adequate servers | The error message associated with the failure. |

**C.1.2.4. Permanent Failure Records 2.1 Format**

A permanent failure indicates that the message that was attempted failed in such a way that it should not be retried further. After logging a permanent failure the message will be discarded. A permanent failure line is an '@' delimited string like the following:

`1064870847@10/00-25593-393A87F3@P@postalengine.com@31@default@5@1@3.89@552 No such account`

| 8 | 3.89 | The total time the message has spent in queue in seconds. |
| 9 | 552 No such account | The error message returned from the remote host. |

**C.1.2.5. Heartbeat Records 2.1 Format**

A heartbeat is written periodically to the log, to indicate that Momentum is still active and may log further data. The heartbeats are used by the web console for real-time reporting. The record format is the same in versions 2.1 and 2.2\. For detailed information see [Section C.1.1.5, “Heartbeat Records Version 2.2”](log_formats.version_2.php#log_formats.mainlog.heartbeat "C.1.1.5. Heartbeat Records Version 2.2").

### C.1.3. The rejectlog.ec Format

This section documents the rejectlog.ec format. Every rejection that momentum performs is written to the `rejectlog.ec` file as a single line as shown in the following example:

```
1236672125: R="10.79.25.142:42601" L="10.79.25.142:25" C="18/00-07149-D7E16B94" PATH="default" ’
PATH_GRP="default" P="awaiting mailfrom" E=550 M=scriptlet ’
CTXCONN=[pathway=default,ehlo_string="EHLO rh52-node1",ehlo_domain=rh52-node1] ’
CTXMESS=[mailfrom_domain=,mailfrom_string="MAIL FROM:<>",mailfrom_localpart=] relaying denied
```

In this case, the fields are delimited by spaces. The fields are:

<a name="log_formats.rejectlog.ec.record.fields"></a>

**Table C.10. rejectlog.ec record fields**

| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1236672125: | The date of delivery in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |

| 10 | CTXMESS=[mailfrom_domain=,mailfrom_string="MAIL FROM:<>",mailfrom_localpart=] | Validation Context for message |
| 11 | relaying denied | Error message |

### C.1.4. The `acctlog.ec` Format

The `acctlog.ec` log contains both authentication entries and authorization entries for the SMTP and Control Listeners. For more information on configuring listeners for logging authentication and authorization events see [Section 2.2, “Authentication, Authorization and Accounting”](conf.aaa.php "2.2. Authentication, Authorization and Accounting").

**C.1.4.1. Authentication Records**

If enabled for the listener, authentication events for Unix domain sockets are logged one per line as shown below:

`1160503808@N@/tmp/2025@@ec-user@1`

If enabled for the listener, authentication events for TCP/IP listeners are logged one per line as shown below:

`1160172232@N@*:2025@10.80.116.126:37164@ec_user@1`

The fields are delimited by `@` signs. `@`, `\`, `\n` and other control characters appearing in a field are escaped by adding an `\` before them. The fields are:

<a name="log_formats.authentication.record.fields"></a>

**Table C.11. Authentication record fields**

| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1160172232 | The date of authentication in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | N | N shows you that it is a log for *authentication*. |
| 2 | *:2025 | The listener endpoint on which the event occurred. |
| 3 | 10.80.116.126:37164 | The IP and port of the peer. For Unix domain connections, this field will be empty. |
| 4 | ec_user | The user name used for the authentication. |
| 5 | 1 | 1 means the authentication is successful. 0 otherwise. |

**C.1.4.2. Authorization Records**

A line is written to `acctlog.ec` for every authorization event. The line is an `@` delimited string. `@`, `\`, `\n` and other control characters appearing in a field are escaped by adding an `\` before them.

Authorization entries might look like the following:

```
1160503811@Z@/tmp/2025@@ec-user@1@summary@users
1160504707@Z@/tmp/2025@@ec-user@0@shutdown
1160172223@Z@*:2025@10.80.116.126:37162@ec-user@1@summary@users
1160172219@Z@*:2025@10.80.116.126:37162@ec-user@0@shutdown
```

A description of the fields follows:

<a name="log_formats.authorization.record.fields"></a>

**Table C.12. Authorization record fields**

| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1160172219 | The date of authorization in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | Z | Z means that this line is for *authorization*. |
| 2 | /tmp/2025 *or* *:2025 | The listener endpoint on which the event occurred. |
| 3 | 10.80.116.126:37162 | The IP and port of the peer. For Unix domain connections this field will be blank. |
| 4 | ec_user | The user name used for the authentication. |
| 5 | 1 | 1 means the user is authorized to run the command. 0 means the authorization failed. -1 means some error occurred during authorization. |
| 6 | summary | The command that was requested to run. |
| 7 | users | The role that matched during successful authorization. |

### C.1.5. The importlog Format

**Configuration Change. ** This feature is available starting from Momentum 2.2.2.29.

You can record the outcome of a spool import operation (see [spool import](console_commands.spool_import.php "spool import")) by configuring a path for the `importlog`. To do this add the following line to the ec_logger module:

```
...
   importlog = /var/log/ecelerity/importlog.ec
```

You should note that, by default, no log rotation is performed for the importlog.

The format for the importlog is:

<a name="log_formats.import.log.fields"></a>

**Table C.13. Import log fields**

| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1064869327 | The date of the event in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | 00/00-25004-31B987F3 | The message's original in-spool message-id. This is a unique value per message. This corresponds with its location in the spool being imported. |
| 2 | I | I marks this log line as an import event. |
| 3 | 00/00-25004-31B987F3 | The message's new in-spool message-id. This is usually the same as the message-id recorded in field 1, but may be altered during import to avoid collisions with existing messages with the same identifier. |
| 4 | 1 | The result indicator. This is a number between 1 and 4 with the following meanings. 1 is complete success, 2 indicates failure during the read of metadata, 3 is failure reading the message from the spool and 4 is failure writing the message into the main Momentum spool. |
| 5 | /var/spool/my-alternative-spool | The base directory containing the spool being imported. |

### C.1.6. The bounce_logger

bounce_logger writes a single logfile, `bouncelog.ec`, which records both in-band (or protocol-time) and out-of-band bounces. The format was designed to be a concise, machine-parseable, computationally inexpensive and complete format for writing information about every bounce message.

**C.1.6.1. The bounce_logger Format 2.2**
### Note

This section documents the bounce_logger format for version *2.2* and later. For the bounce logger format for version 2.1 see [Section C.1.6.2, “The bounce_logger 2.1 Format”](log_formats.version_2.php#bounce_logger.2.1.format "C.1.6.2. The bounce_logger 2.1 Format").

The `bouncelog.ec` file logs bounces and heartbeats. The log entry format differs depending upon the event type.

**C.1.6.1.1. Bounce Records**

Every bounce that Momentum witnesses is written to the `bouncelog.ec` file as a single line as show in the example below. (this example has been wrapped for display purposes; it will be a single line in the log file).

```
1064868656@91/6D-07914-E67BC044@B@johndoe@example.fict@info@postalengine.com@group-a@binding-a@21@24@10.0.0.1@554
 5.4.7 [internal] exceeded max time without delivery
```

As in all ec_logger-formatted entries, the fields are delimited by `@` signs. The fields are:

### Note

This section documents the bounce_logger format for version *2.1*. For the bounce logger format for later versions see [Section C.1.6.1, “The bounce_logger Format 2.2”](log_formats.version_2.php#bounce_logger.format "C.1.6.1. The bounce_logger Format 2.2")

The `bouncelog.ec` file logs bounces and heartbeats. The log entry format differs depending upon the event type.
