## Search Help

Search for a single word or perform multi-word searches by enclosing your search in quotation marks.

Where you have multiple words but no quotation marks, an **OR** search is performed. For example, **"REST Injection"** searches for the phrase **"REST Injection"**, and, without quotation marks, searches for **REST OR Injection**--the operator is understood.

### Warning

You must escape the following special characters: **+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \**. Use the **\** character as the escape character. For example: **B0/00-11719-46C328D4\:default\:**

You can also perform **AND** searches, for example, **rest AND port** (no quotation marks) finds pages where both these words occur.

Terms used in searches are case-insensitive but operators are not. Alphabetic operators **must** be in uppercase.

Other operators can also be used. For more information see "[Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html)". Use of fields in searches is not currently supported.

## Name

max_resident_messages — threshold above which messages are not held in memory

## Synopsis

`Max_Resident_Messages = 32768`

<a name="idp5803648"></a>
## Description

**Configuration Change. ** This feature is available starting from Momentum 2.2.

`max_resident_messages` is used to control the maximum number of messages held concurrently in memory. A value of 0 sets no limit. A rough guide to setting this option is to divide the maximum amount of RAM that you want to reserve for messages by your growbuf_size. For more information about the `growbuf_size` option see [growbuf_size](conf.ref.growbuf_size.php "growbuf_size").

The default value for `max_resident_messages` is `32768`. However, this default value is typically overridden in the `ecelerity.conf` file and set to `65536`.

### Warning

This is an advanced option. Setting this option to small non-zero values can have deleterious effects on performance. Thorough testing is recommended prior to deployment in a production environment.

## Scope

`max_resident_messages` is valid in the binding, binding_group and global scopes.
